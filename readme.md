- Recommend weekly par levels with a safety buffer
- Simulate stock performance using historical data

## 📊 Key Features
- Rolling average + std dev forecasting
- Rule-based par level recommendations
- Real-world simulation to test stockouts/overstock
- Clear visualizations and insights

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📦 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` in Jupyter
